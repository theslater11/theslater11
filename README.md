## My name is Jonathan Slater and I have a talent for Leadership.
'''
Since I was 14 years old I've continually have been placed in positions where the decisions I make directly affect the people around me. I make quick decisions with limited information and a pretty good "win-rate". A "win" being the best solution for all combinations of interested parties in the long-term, not the easiest or quickest fix. This is a very important distinction to me.

I learned python to help me process large datasets and use information gathered to make more informed decisions. My experiance is different than most programmers, I have lived a full life in the real world: food service, social media, retail, factory line work, contracting, public school teaching. I have met and connected with so many people of different backrounds and cultures. That is the type of invaluable experience that no amount of formal education can teach.

I'm looking to collabrate on projects who need a decision maker and leader. I have only coded for a year, and I understand the limitations I may have when it comes to technical knowledge. I make up for that with my ability to listen and learn specialized knowledge quickly. This leads to great respect for individuals and their crafts, and open lines of communication.
